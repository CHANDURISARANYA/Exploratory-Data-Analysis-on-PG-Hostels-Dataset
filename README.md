ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Dataset Type: Uncleaned/raw hostel listings dataset

Key Features: Location, Rent, Sharing Type, Amenities (WiFi, Food, AC), Distance from landmarks, Room Type

Objective: Analyze patterns, clean the data, and visualize useful trends in PG accommodations

ðŸ§° Tools and Technologies
Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas â€“ data handling

numpy â€“ numerical processing

matplotlib & seaborn â€“ data visualization

missingno â€“ missing value analysis (if used)

ðŸ“Š Key Insights from EDA
Top locations with the most PG listings

Most common rent ranges for 1/2/3-sharing accommodations

Distribution of room types and their rent trends

Availability of amenities like WiFi, Food, and AC

Outlier detection in rent and distance

Correlation between amenities and higher rent

ðŸ“¸ Sample Visualizations
Bar plots showing PG distribution by location

Histograms of rent ranges

Pie charts for sharing types

Heatmaps showing feature correlations

ðŸ”® Future Work
Convert this EDA into a dashboard (using Streamlit or Power BI)

Apply clustering to segment PGs by affordability or features

Train a recommendation system based on user preferences
